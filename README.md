# Fast MathJax
A simple plugin to show beautiful MathJax LaTex in WordPress article without slowing it down.

# Description
The plugin won't load MathJax JS globally on the WordPress site. To load MathJax in a specific post, the shortcode `[mathjax]` is needed to be placed anywhere in the post.
Then, the following LaTeX syntaxes for inline and display math can be used there:

- Inline Math: 
  - `$E=mc^2$` 
  - `\(E=mc^2\)`   
- Display Math: 
  - `$$E=mc^2$$` 
  - `\[E=mc^2\]`
